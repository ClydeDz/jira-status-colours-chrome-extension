# Jira Status Colours Chrome Extension
Customize the colours of your Jira statuses.

## Why?
Do you also find it hard to spot the statuses of your Jira tickets? Do you wish they were coloured so at a glance you could see how many stories are in progress, how many are in review and how many are done? Don't look any further because this Chrome Extension allows you to customize the colours of Jira statuses. 

Out of the box, it comes with a set of preset statuses and colours, but you can update this list as per your convenience. To head over to the configuration page, just click on the extension's icon in your browser and select options. Once you've configured the statuses and their colours to your hearts content, you can then head over to your Jira board and you should be able to see those colours. 

Note: This works for Jira Cloud only.

Have a productive time ahead!
